        <p>On the web everything is connected through links nested in buttons, messages, images or adverts. The so-called Call-To-Action buttons (CTA) are meant to push us to interact and engage with the content on the site. Sometimes we fall for it, sometimes we don’t.
            Everyone in our group takes for a day a screenshot of the most prominent Call-To-Action button when entering a website, for every website visited, no matter how often. We defined a little set of rules, but every member is free to adapt them based on their personal criterias.
            We collect the buttons and their intended link destination and display them arranged together on a website. These collections of CTAs will take you alongside our daily journey through the web. Whether it’s the sign-up, a share-button or another prominent CTA, the collective visualisation of those shows where our curiosity and impulses have taken us and perhaps give an understanding of one's basic activities. Some buttons might show up multiple times, some others not, but in the end that just reflects the individual behaviour everyone has on the internet.
