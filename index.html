            <h1>Where are we heading today?</h1>
            <p>On the web everything is connected through links nested in buttons, messages, images or adverts. The so-called Call-To-Action buttons (CTA) are meant to push us to interact and engage with the content on the site. Sometimes we fall for it,
                sometimes we don’t.</p>
            <p> Everyone in our group takes for a day a screenshot of the most prominent Call-To-Action button when entering a website, for every website visited.</p>
            <p>We defined a little set of rules, but every member is free to adapt them based on their personal criterias.</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a Screenshot of the most prominent CTA when entering a website, for every website, no matter how often visited</li>
                <li>Time frame will be a single day (unless too little data is collected)</li>
                <li>Link to the destination (if too time consuming, then the URL you found the CTA on</li>
                <li>Author can decide on personal criterias what CTA to choose</li>
                <li>Collection of CTAs will be displayed in a viewport filling arrangement like different sized pixels creating a whole image.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>We collect the buttons and their intended link destination and display them arranged together on a website. Whether it’s the sign-up, a share-button or another prominent CTA, the collective visualisation of those shows where our curiosity
                and impulses have taken us and perhaps give an understanding of one's basic activities. Some buttons might show up multiple times, some others not, but in the end that just reflects the individual behaviour everyone has on the internet.</p>
