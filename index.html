          <h1>Where are we heading today?</h1>
          <h2>(Max Werner, Niklas Buchfink & Ruben Borer, 2022)</h2>
          <p>
            On the web everything is connected â€“ with links, buttons or images.
            But it takes a human being to navigate through it and in doing so,
            everyone behaves differently.
          </p>
          <p>
            For one day, every group member collected the Call-To-Actions (in
            our case mostly buttons) on websites that he visited. The result is
            a visualisation of everyone's journey through the tools we used and
            the interests we pursued.
          </p>
          <p>
            The process consists of taking a screenshot of any meaningful
            Call-To-Action on the site visited, linking to it the destination or
            URL where it originally was located, and then trying to be as
            consistent as possible.
